# capture-device-information
This JavaScript can be used in conjunction with Checkbox's [JavaScript Action Item]() feature to automatically capture device information and submit it alongside information submitted by the respondent.

The code will automatically execute when the user lands on the survey page and can be configured to your liking. For example, should the fields be hidden from the respondent? Should they be read-only? Exactly what data is captured? etc.

:warning: **Note:** This code is for exemplary purposes only. Before collecting any data regarding respondents, ensure that it adheres to any relevant regulations regarding user data privacy and security. Use at your own discretion.
