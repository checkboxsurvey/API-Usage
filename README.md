# Scripts-And-Tools
This repository stores scripts and tools that interact with the Checkbox platform, including API usage to retrieve data and make changes, as well as custom javascript to extend survey functionality.
Use them to get things done or as samples/inspiration for your own scripts.
Please submit a pull request if you have one you'd like to share.
